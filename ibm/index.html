I was a part of the team responsible for the development, testing and operation of Event Streams on Cloud, which is a Tier 1 IBM Cloud service running on multiple IBM Cloud datacentres around the world. <br />In a nutshell, the offering is an event-based message streaming service based on Apache Kafka. Using multiple IBM Cloud technologies in the background, Event Streams is trusted by many clients to be a fast, secure and scalable message-streaming platform. <br /><br />The team operated in a very dynamic manner, which reflects the CI-CD (Continuous Integration-Continuous Deployment) ecosystem we adopted. Since we operated in a DevOps (Development/Operations) way, no member of the team owned any component, and no member was obviously more `senior` than the others. Each member got assigned a pair each week and eventually rotated between the available roles in the DevOps cycle.<br /><br />At a given point in time, a pair would be either in the &lsquo;Operations&rsquo; squad or the &lsquo;Development&rsquo; squad. </div></div><div id='stacks_out_16_page10' class='stacks_out'><div id='stacks_in_16_page10' class='stacks_in com_yourhead_stack_header_stack'><h3>The Operations Squad</h3></div></div><div id='stacks_out_18_page10' class='stacks_out'><div id='stacks_in_18_page10' class='stacks_in text_stack'>The aim of this squad was to ensure the health and security compliance of the Event Streams deployments, i.e. make sure our clients are happy and&nbsp;provide them with&nbsp;uninterrupted service availability.&nbsp;Engineers in this squad were also responsible for making sure we're meeting certain compliance standards.<br /><br /><ul class=""><li>Primary role:</li></ul>Focus on production environments, make sure all daily promotions&nbsp;go smoothly through our&nbsp;pipeline (which takes our code changes from our development environment to our production environment).&nbsp;I would also handle all alerts from our automated monitoring systems that relate to service availability and be responsible we are meeting our compliance standards (HIPAA, SOC2, etc).<br /><br /><ul class=""><li>Secondary role:</li></ul>Directly follows the week spent on primary. Aim is to fix issues which deemed problematic during&nbsp;the&nbsp;week&nbsp;on primary, and to give the primary pair any additional help that may be required.<br /></div></div><div id='stacks_out_20_page10' class='stacks_out'><div id='stacks_in_20_page10' class='stacks_in com_yourhead_stack_header_stack'><h3>The Development Squad</h3></div></div><div id='stacks_out_22_page10' class='stacks_out'><div id='stacks_in_22_page10' class='stacks_in text_stack'><ul class=""><li>Feature Development</li></ul>Here, work is divided into 2-week long tasks in the form of &ldquo;user stories&rdquo;. Thinking of tasks as user stories rather than just pieces of work is an essential aspect of IBM&rsquo;s Design Thinking culture which helps always keep the user in mind and not lose track of the objective.<br />Each pair in the development squad would be assigned a user story to work on for the sprint (2 weeks). Writing unit tests is an integral part of developing new features for our service. The offering is based on a microservice architecture, with containers deployed on Kubernetes clusters. We wrote code mainly in Go Lang for our microservices, and we push changes through our 3-stage pipeline which delivers code to production daily.<br /><br /><ul class=""><li>Integration/End-to-End testing:</li></ul>The other side of the development role is to write system, integration and end-to-end tests for testing larger aspects of our code.

Such problems can be addressed by the squad lead, or by anyone else in the scrum. Scrums usually take under 15 minutes. Our Event Streams team in China would also be with us virtually in the scrum to hand-over any outstanding issues (as their workday ended when ours began).</li></ul><br /><ul class=""><li>We would then start working &ndash; I would join my pair at one of the pairing stations, where we share one laptop, but each one has a monitor, keyboard and mouse. This means that we can take turns to &lsquo;drive&rsquo; during each coding session. Working in pairs allowed the sharing of knowledge about our complex architecture, and also brought creative value due to having two different perspectives tackling each problem. This phase formed the bulk of the day. If we were in the &lsquo;Operations&rsquo; squad, we would be monitoring alerts systems and checking that everything is up and running. If we are in the &lsquo;Development&rsquo; squad, we would be coding and developing new features.</li></ul><br /><ul class=""><li>If we reached an issue which we felt requires input from more people, we call for a &lsquo;breakout&rsquo;.

We had weekly retrospective sessions in which we reflected about the good and bad about anything in the team. We make constant adjustments in the way we work based on these reflections and hence the team is constantly becoming more productive.<br /><br />The agile workflow as well allowed a very high-paced development cycle, meaning that our customers got daily updates with code we were just working on a few days beforehand. It is amazing to see your effort take this little time to have an effect. Working agile also involved us getting weekly updates from the team&rsquo;s Offering Manager, who is charge of the business/client side of our product. Being aware of how we are doing from that perspective brought great value as we got feedback from clients which we could use to make improvements incrementally and iteratively.<br /><br />The fact that everyone in the team rotated through the different roles created a &ldquo;shared ownership&rdquo; culture. We all thoroughly understand our product, and nobody was &ldquo;in charge&rdquo; of a specific part of it. This also means that I became in some way involved in all sub-projects running within my team, which is incredible really. <br /><br />IBM runs a lot of educational workshops and reading groups for different competencies, which anyone is welcome to register for and attend. Managers were very supportive of employees working on improving their skills and so would encourage taking an hour or so to attend such events at work.<br /></div></div><div id='stacks_out_50_page10' class='stacks_out'><div id='stacks_in_50_page10' class='stacks_in html_stack'><hr></div></div></div></div>

					<h3 id="sidebar_title">The most important thing I learnt at IBM</h3>
					<br />If I had to pick one thing, I would say it is being adaptable. I found this to be crucial both technically and with dealing with people - realising that I should never fixate the way I work or the way I think. The technological world is changing very quickly and keeping up with it involves being agile, curious and always ready to pivot into newer ways of doing things. To become highly productive while working with different people, one has to master the skill of adaptability and not be stuck in their ways.

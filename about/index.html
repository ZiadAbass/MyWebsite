<p>Currently, I am on a placement year at IBM as a Cloud Dev/Ops software developer. My team is responsible for developing and maintaining an IBM Cloud service called <i>Event Streams</i>. </p>

<p>Event Streams is a very successful IBM Cloud service running in multiple IBM Cloud datacenters around the globe and installed in a number of dedicated accounts. Event Streams provides a fast, scalable messaging service available to customers of IBM Cloud. It also underpins multiple IBM cloud technologies.
<br />
<br /> The Event Streams team has been at the forefront of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CICD) SW development for the last two years; delivering the initial offering and then rapidly scaling out the service to multiple environments worldwide. We operate in a true agile, continuous delivery model utilising the latest tools and technologies. When something isn’t working, we fix it, improve it, and then apply the knowledge learnt. <br />
<br />
Learn more about Event Streams <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/event-streams-for-cloud" target="_blank">here</a>
<br />
<br />
After this year, I will be back to the University of Leeds to complete the final year of my MEng Mechatronics &amp; Robotics course.
<br />
Generally, projects I have worked on fall under several categories – from purely mechanical, like constructing a trebuchet designed to throw basketballs in a specific projectile motion, to purely software, like creating iOS applications. The projects I enjoy most are ones involving a bit of each field, like the autonomous rover I designed, built and programmed within a team, or the remote-controlled buggy where control accuracy was the goal.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>My passion for the art of developing iOS mobile apps sparked through a brief Objective-C fundamentals course in Leeds University. I took it further by learning Swift on my own over the following summer, and from there onwards I have worked on various projects, learning more with every task I take on. </p>

<p>I applied for a training program with Icosol Smart Technologies in Cairo to work with the iOS team on their various projects. The experience was nothing short of incredible. I learnt so much about coding efficiently, developing apps professionally and collaboration in coding.</p>

<p>I am currently a freelance iOS front-end developer. Take a look at my main projects <a href="http://ziadabass.com/iosapps">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="themedicalworld">The Medical World</h2>

<p><br /></p>

<p>A long while back, losing a dear family member to cancer made me wonder; was it possible to employ my interest in mechanics and fascination by robotics to help in medical advances, specifically involving cancer? I was sceptical at first, but after extensive research I was amazed to discover that robots can now perform full invasive surgeries, and that tiny injected robots can be designed to mimic the exact motions of a doctor to perform a delicate operation within the body. I felt determined to utilise my passion for mechanics to improve cancer treatment techniques through the use of micro robotics and nanotechnology in the future.</p>

<p>This motivated me to apply for an internship program with Siemens Healthcare to work with their engineers in troubleshooting and fixing major Siemens medical machines like MRI scanners, C.T. scanners and X-Ray scanners whenever clients reported an issue or malfunction. Understanding how these intricate machines operate was fascinating for me considering my interest in integrating mechatronics into the medical world.</p>

<p>All this, along with a ‘Robotic Colonoscopy’ project I worked on with medical engineering students pushed me to choose the ‘Biomedical Engineering Design’ course in my third year, to hopefully make me more knowledgeable of the fusion of these two fields, and help me utilise this knowledge to make a difference in the world. More info about that project can be found <a href="http://ziadabass.com/projects">here</a>.</p>

<p>Winston Churchill once said that we make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give, and I couldn’t agree more. I worked in my school’s environmental club raising awareness for various issues, urging students to be the change the world needed. After entering university, I became part of ‘Engineers Without Borders’ - a creative society based on finding new means of sustainable development based on engineering technologies. I am also a regular visitor to many juvenile Egyptian orphanages for no purpose other than psychological support. I strive to be part of more organisations that are based upon giving.</p>

<p>I am a huge fan of travelling and exploring. Going around learning more about people and cultures different to yours is what gives life meaning.</p>

<p>I’ve been to the countries below so far...</p>
